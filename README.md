# Data Structure

## Project Overview

This project is a hobby implementation of fundamental data structures in C.  
The primary goal is to practice and deepen understanding of how common data structures are built and operate at a low level.

## Features

- Written in pure C for maximal portability
- Simple, clean code focused on educational value

## Status

- **Active**: Adding new data structures as time allows
- **Implemented so far:**
  * Singly linked list

## Future Plans

- Add more data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, trees, etc.)

## Why?

This repository is meant for personal growth, experimentation, and to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in classic data structures and C programming.
