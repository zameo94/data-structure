# Algorithms and Data Structure

## Project Overview

This project is a hobby implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.  
The primary goal is to practice and deepen understanding of how common data structures and algorithms are built and operate at a low level.

## Features

- Written in pure C for maximal portability
- Simple, clean code focused on educational value

## Status

- **Active**: Adding new data structures as time allows
- **Implemented so far:**
  * Singly linked list
  * SLL Stack
  * SLL Queue

- **Active**: Adding new algorithms as time allows
- **Implemented so far:**
  * Linear search
  * Bubble sort
  * Merge sort
  * Quick sort

## Future Plans

- Add more data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, trees, etc.) and algorithms
